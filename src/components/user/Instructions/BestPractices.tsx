            Be mindful of camera angle and the parallax effect. Contours are
            based on the photo&apos;s perspectiveâ€”taller, off-center objects may
            appear distorted. For best accuracy, photograph tall objects
            individually from directly above.

            Maintain at least a 0.25 inch margin between objects and between
            objects and the edges of the container. This ensures clean
            separation and reliable cutting.

            For foam inserts or other fitted layouts, make sure your arrangement

            For tool drawers, it is strongly recommended to remove the drawer,
            arrange the tools inside it, and photograph from above. This ensures
            the layout remains within the actual drawer dimensions.

            Lumashape preserves their spatial layout, so the contours in the DXF
